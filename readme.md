## 🎭 Overview

Welcome to the repo that exists solely to click buttons so you don’t have to.


## 🚀 What This Does

This project runs automated end-to-end tests over **LEGGERA2**, to make sure it behaves like it’s supposed to.
If it doesn’t, Playwright will gleefully take a screenshot of your failure and store it forever.

## 🛠️ How to Install / Use

Honestly… there’s not much point in actually using this app unless you want to test **LEGGERA2**.  
If that’s the case, well… understandable — have a good day 😎  

Anyway, you’re totally free to **download the repo and get inspired**, peek at the code, and see what I’ve built! 

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Playwright.git
```
```
npm i
npx playwright test
```
## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Playwright** – for testing web apps like a speedrunner on caffeine  
- **Node.js** – javascript belongs in the backend  
- **TypeScript** – I like my pain statically typed
